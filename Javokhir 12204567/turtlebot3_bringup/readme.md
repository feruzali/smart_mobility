# Bringup TurtleBot3

Open a new terminal from PC with Ctrl + Alt + T and connect to Raspberry Pi with its IP address.

The username is turtle and password is admin.

```
$ ssh turtle@{IP_ADDRESS_OF_RASPBERRY_PI}
```

Bring up basic packages to start TurtleBot3 applications. Please use the keyword burger for the TURTLEBOT3_MODEL parameter.

```
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
```

When the TURTLEBOT3_MODEL is set to burger, the terminal output will look like below.

```
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
