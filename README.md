# TurtleBot Kitchen Waiter Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the TurtleBot Kitchen Waiter project! This project aims to utilize TurtleBot as a waiter in a kitchen environment, showcasing the capabilities of ROS2 in a practical application. By leveraging the functionalities of TurtleBot and ROS2, we aim to demonstrate how robotics can be employed in real-world scenarios, specifically in a restaurant setting.
