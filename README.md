# TurtleBot Kitchen Waiter Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the TurtleBot Kitchen Waiter project! This project aims to utilize TurtleBot as a waiter in a kitchen environment, showcasing the capabilities of ROS2 in a practical application. By leveraging the functionalities of TurtleBot and ROS2, we aim to demonstrate how robotics can be employed in real-world scenarios, specifically in a restaurant setting.

## ROS2 Functions and Contributors

- **turtlebot3_bringup**: a ROS package responsible for "bringing up" or initializing the TurtleBot hardware and software components. This package is essential for starting and configuring the TurtleBot system to make it ready for operation.- Javokhir Jambulov 12204567
- **Ros2 geometry_msg**:  in ROS provides fundamental geometric message types, including Point, Pose, and Twist, enabling communication of geometric data between different nodes in a ROS system. These messages are widely used for describing positions, orientations, and velocities in robot control in Android Application - Javokhir Jambulov 12204567
- **Ros2 nav_msgs**:  in ROS provides message types for robot navigation, such as odometry and path planning, facilitating communication between different components in a navigation system. These messages are used for nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid in Android App- Javokhir Jambulov 12204567


Special thanks to the open-source ROS2 community for providing valuable resources and support.

## Conclusion

The TurtleBot Kitchen Waiter project showcases the versatility of ROS2 and TurtleBot in practical applications. By combining autonomous navigation, object recognition, human interaction, and task automation, we demonstrate how ROS2 enables the creation of intelligent and interactive robotic systems for real-world scenarios.
