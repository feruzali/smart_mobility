Overview:
ROS node that implements obstacle avoidance for the TurtleBot3 using laser scan data.
The robot stops if it detects an obstacle within a safe stopping distance.

Node Details:
- Subscribes to the 'scan' topic to receive laser scan data.
- Computes the minimum distance to obstacles within the specified field of view.
- Publishes Twist messages on the 'cmd_vel' topic to control the robot's movement.
- Stops the robot if an obstacle is detected within a safe stopping distance.

Parameters:
- LINEAR_VEL: Linear velocity of the TurtleBot3.
- STOP_DISTANCE: Minimum distance to obstacles for stopping.
- LIDAR_ERROR: Error term to account for Lidar inaccuracies.
- SAFE_STOP_DISTANCE: Safe stopping distance considering Lidar error.
